# Conway's Game of Life in Javascript #

This is an alpha version of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Javascript. Every time I tell someone about this little world and its amazing properties, it ends in disappointment: there aren't any good versions of Conway's Game for modern browsers. My goal here is to build something people can play with (esp on their phones), and let them explore some of the [interesting patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) that have been discovered.
